# UdeSchooll-HTML-CSS

In this project, I used HTML and CSS codes in detail. In addition, I used Boostrap. Since I am interested in following the developing technologies

closely, I worked meticulously on each piece of code and tried to make it the best. I made my project more elegant with visuals and kept it clean 
 
so as not to tire the user.
